### Here's a FunEduFarm gameplay video:

No worries. The boy from the video does not play every day. He is only given a tablet occasionally, for example, during doctor's visits, etc.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

Currently, I am learning web development, including TypeScript, React, and other related technologies. I have some ideas of my own that I would like to bring to life.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

I would like to create games for children similar to FunEduFarm. However, as the only programmer on the FunEduApp team (www.funeduapp.com), I do not have enough time or financial resources to independently code and test a large number of features. Therefore, I am seeking individuals interested in developing games, as well as financial support and social media promotion to help bring my vision to life.
